# What this research will show:
- **Which RL algorithm works best in KAZ for different agents?**
- **Does independent learning (IQL, IPPO) work well in cooperative settings?**
- **Do mixed-algorithm teams perform better than homogeneous teams?**
- **Does multi-agent coordination (QMIX) outperform independent RL?**
